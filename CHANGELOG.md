<h1>Changelog:</h1>
<h2>a0.0.1 (March 23rd, 2025):</h2>
<p>WynnOS now runs! What an outstanding feature, don't I deserve a pat on the back? But seriously, this OS does nothing, it just runs.</p>
<h2>a0.0.2 (March 23rd, 2025):</h2>
<p>Booting now displays: Welcome to WynnOS! [Version: a0.0.2]</p>
<h2>a0.0.3 (March 23rd, 2025):</h2>

<h2>INDEV: a0.1.0 (March 2xth, 2025):</h2>
<p>DELAYED: STILL IN PROGRESS!</p>
